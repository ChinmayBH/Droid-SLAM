One of the advantages of probabilistic modeling of epidemics is that it allows for the quantification of uncertainty and variability in the spread of the disease.
For example, simulations can be used to estimate the probability of different outcomes under different scenarios, such as the probability of an outbreak occurring or the probability of a certain number of cases occurring within a certain time frame.
This type of analysis can be useful for informing public health policy and decision-making.
